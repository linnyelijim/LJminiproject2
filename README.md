# **Mini Project 2**

> This project manipulates the data within a chosen API and converts as much or 
> as little of it as you wish into pie charts. For example, this version compares 
> calories, fats, proteins, fiber, and sugars in the different items I used to make 
> dinner: Chickpea, Sweet Potato, Quinoa, Yellow Onion, Red Pepper, Hummus, and Kale.

## Prerequisite
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:
> * You have installed the latest version of python
> * You have installed all required plugins `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Using Mini Project 2 
To use Mini Project 2, follow these steps:
> * Choose to keep or replace the current API (if you replace it, make sure the data is compatible with a pie chart)
> * For easiest replacement, use an API from [api-ninjas](https://api-ninjas.com/)
> * Enter at least one (food) item(s) into `query=''`
> * Replace the contents of `'X-Api-Key':''` with your key
> * Ensure the data set is correctly stored into Pandas dataframe
> * From there, simply run the program unless you wish to adjust the sizing or aesthetic of the graph(s).
